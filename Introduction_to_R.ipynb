This notebook provides an introduction to R designed for students. No previous experience is needed.\n",

        "- Every function has a 'help(fn)' page telling how it is used, what operation is run, and what output it produces with references and examples that can be cut-and-paste into an R console. It is essential for both novice and experienced R programmers to read help files.\n",
        "- A hash mark ( # ) denotes comments in an R script.  A semi-colon ( ; ) has the same action as a carriage return."
